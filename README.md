## Modes:

### Alerts

Enter a State abbreviation such as NY (New York), FL (Florida), MD (Maryland) etc. and get the current weather advisories for that state.

### Forecast

Enter a latitiude and longitude within the US and get the forecast for the next week for that location.

## How to improve further

Figure out a way to access the user's location in the browser to get current weather without having to deal with latitude and longitude. Or Selectable by city or address.

Improve UI/UX especially the default numbers that show up because the API uses numbers as keys. (minor)

Add graphics for weather conditions

Add functionality for world weather(non US)

Port the app to mobile
